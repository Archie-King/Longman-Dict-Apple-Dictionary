# Longman EnEn Online for Mac Apple Dictionary
## Introduction
**Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English Online - En-En**

This is a folder converted from .mdx dictionary files and I have solved all the format issues. Of course, it also has voices and images. You can directly install it for Apple Dictionary.

## Install
1. Open the system terminal or iTerm in the current folder and enter `make && make install`. The dictionary will be installed in this path (~/Library/Dictionaries/).
2. Reboot Apple Dictionary and start this dictionary in settings (command + ,).
3. Finished. You can delete this folder if you want.

**Thanks to the .mdx resources from https://www.pdawiki.com/forum/.**
